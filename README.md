## 🌟 Project Introduction

In a world that is increasingly demanding and more digitalized, many people pay less attention to their health and sleep quality. They are unaware that daily activities, stress levels, and their overall health conditions can be the causes of sleep disorders. The most common sleep disorders are insomnia and sleep apnea. Insomnia makes it difficult for people to fall asleep or stay asleep, while sleep apnea causes temporary pauses in breathing during sleep. Sleep disorders are often experienced by many and can disrupt daily performance and mood for those who are affected.

### 💡 Our Solution: DreamGuard

DreamGuard is an innovative mobile application designed to help people in Indonesia effectively manage sleep problems like insomnia and sleep apnea. Our app aims to:

- 🕵️ Detect sleep disorders through tailored predictions
- 🚀 Offer personalized recommendations and insights
- 💤 Include a sleep scheduler to improve sleep habits
- 📊 Provide comprehensive sleep health statistics
- 🔒 Ensure user data privacy
- 🌈 Enhance overall well-being, productivity, and emotional health

#### Key Features:
- **Predictive Analysis**: Identify whether users experience normal sleep, insomnia, or sleep apnea
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailored insights based on user responses
- **Sleep Scheduler**: Build better sleep consistency and habits
- **Real-time Insights & Statistics**: Continuous monitoring and guidance

Our goal is to make sleep health management simple, accessible, and truly impactful for everyone, empowering users to take control of their sleep health and ultimately improve their quality of life.
