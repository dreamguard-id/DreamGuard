# DreamGuard - Your Sleep Health Companion for Sleep Disorder Detection and Quality Improvement [Machine Learning]

### Steps To Generate Model
1. Go to kaggle and upload it to google colab
2. After connecting to kaggle download the zip dataset from kaggle using collab
3. Use Tensorflow 2.9 and restart runtime before running the rest of the cell
4. Run the rest of the cell and dont forget to save the model
